summary: "CycleGAN enables image translation between two domains without paired training examples, using cycle consistency loss to enforce that translating an image to the other domain and back yields the original."

## Key Ideas

- **Unpaired training**: Unlike pix2pix, CycleGAN doesn't need paired examples (e.g., same scene photographed in summer and winter).
- **Cycle consistency**: If you translate image X→Y and then Y→X, you should get back X. This constraint prevents mode collapse.
- **Two generators, two discriminators**: G: X→Y, F: Y→X, D_X, D_Y.

## Loss Function

Total loss = adversarial loss (both directions) + λ × cycle consistency loss

The cycle consistency loss is simply ||F(G(x)) - x|| + ||G(F(y)) - y||

## Applications

- Style transfer (photos ↔ paintings)
- Season transfer (summer ↔ winter)
- Horse ↔ zebra (the famous demo)
- Medical imaging (my PWS research)

## Personal Notes

I applied this to PWS birthmark research — translating between healthy faces and PWS-affected faces. The main challenge was data quality: medical images have inconsistent lighting and angles, which the model sometimes confuses with domain-specific features. Data augmentation and careful preprocessing helped significantly.
