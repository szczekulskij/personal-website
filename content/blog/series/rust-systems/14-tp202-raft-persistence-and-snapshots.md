## Overview

**Course**: TP 202 - Distributed Systems in Rust
**Lab 2C**: Persistence and Snapshots

**Task**: Add persistence so that Raft nodes can recover from crashes and resume. Implement snapshot-based log compaction so that logs don't grow without bound.

## Key Concepts

### Persistent State

TODO - currentTerm, votedFor, log[] must survive restarts

### Snapshots & Log Compaction

TODO - InstallSnapshot RPC, discarding prefix of log

### Recovery

TODO - replaying from persisted state

## Implementation
